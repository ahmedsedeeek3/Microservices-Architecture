# Microservices Architecture
 Microservices Architecture
i made this project to  demonstrates a basic microservices architecture implemented in Go.
In Futur i will be adding more detailes implrmrntions and add
more service .
feel free to contact me @ ahmedsedeeek@gmail.com


## Components

- API Gateway
- Service Discovery
- Load Balancer
- Message Broker (placeholder)
- Microservices


how it works??

The API Gateway will start on port 8080, and two example microservices will start on ports 8081 and 8082.
## Usage
Send requests to `http://localhost:8080/service1` or `http://localhost:8080/service2` to interact with the microservices through the API Gateway.
